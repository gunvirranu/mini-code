# mini-huff

`mini-huff` is a golf-scripted Huffman compression scheme implementation. It utilizes a basic form of Huffman coding and is meant to be pretty small (the code itself *and* the outputs it produces :P).

I call this **"compressed compression"**, just a little play on words for ya there.

# Usage

```
./mini_huff.py {compress|decompress} <infile> <outfile>
```
