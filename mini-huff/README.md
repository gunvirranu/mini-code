# mini-huff

`mini-huff` is a mini compression implementation. It utilizes a basic form of Huffman coding, and is meant to be pretty small (the code itself *and* and the output it produces :P ).

I call this **"compressed compression"**, just a little play of words for ya there.

## Usage

```
./mini_huff.py {compress|decompress} <infile> <outfile>
```

## Explanation

Just read the code, it's "self-documenting". But if you want the easy way out, see [`EXPLAINED`](EXPLAINED.md).
