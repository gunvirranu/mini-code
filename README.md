# mini code

This is my repository of (mostly useless) code golfs. Each program is meant to be as small as possible while still having "acceptable" performance. Currenty, everything is written in Python 3.

# Structure

Each folder contains a project with:

 * Program source code
 * README with a description and the usage
 * EXPLANATION with detailed/commented code

# Programs

| Program           | Description                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| [mini-huff]       | Huffman compression           |
