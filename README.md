# mini-code

Mini prototype implementations of random stuff. It's *sorta* code golf, but also about distilling some concepts to their bare bones. Basically, I'm trying to minimize the number of lines, but without any tricks like `;` or `__import__`. Currently, everything is written in Python 3.

## Why

Uhh...

## Programs

| Program           | Description                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| [mini-huff]       | Huffman compression           |
